What Is Peer Pressure?
  Peer pressure is the process by which members of the same social group influence other members to do things that they may be resistant to, 
  or might not otherwise choose to do.

Types of Peer Pressure:- 
  Spoken vs. Unspoken Peer Pressure :-
    As the name suggests, spoken peer pressure is when someone verbally influences another person to do something. 
    For instance, a teenager might influence their friend to smoke a cigarette by saying, "Come on, one cigarette won't hurt."
    
  Direct vs. Indirect Peer Pressure
    Direct peer pressure is when a person uses verbal or nonverbal cues to persuade someone to do something. 
    The example mentioned above of a teen handing another teen a cigarette is also an instance of direct peer pressure because,
    the teen on the receiving end must decide on the spot how they're going to respond.
    
  Positive vs. Negative Peer Pressure
    Finally, peer pressure can be described as either positive or negative. 
    Positive peer pressure is when a person is influenced by others to engage in a beneficial or productive behavior.
