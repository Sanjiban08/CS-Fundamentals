What is Database?
The database is a collection of inter-related data which is used to retrieve, insert and delete the data efficiently.
It is also used to organize the data in the form of a table, schema, views, and reports, etc.

Characteristics of DBMS:- 
* It uses a digital repository established on a server to store and manage the information.
* It can provide a clear and logical view of the process that manipulates data.
* DBMS contains automatic backup and recovery procedures.
* It contains ACID properties which maintain data in a healthy state in case of failure.

Advantages of DBMS:- 
* Controls database redundancy: It can control data redundancy because it stores all the data in one single database file and that recorded data is placed in the database.
* Data sharing: In DBMS, the authorized users of an organization can share the data among multiple users.

Disadvantages of DBMS:-
* Cost of Hardware and Software: It requires a high speed of data processor and large memory size to run DBMS software.
* Size: It occupies a large space of disks and large memory to run them efficiently.
